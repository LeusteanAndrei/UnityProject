We'd like to receive the feedback on teams.
### Descriere Joc
The game has multiple scenes, the relevant ones are Gliding, Level 2 and 3 ( this one also has a laser ) . If the player touches the lasers, then a message in the console will appear.
Please build the game if there are issues, they might be due to running it in the editor.
### Mechanics
w,a,s,d - moving

spacebar - jumping ( can double jump )
- for the first jump, upon holding the jump button longer, the character jumps higher
- in the Gliding scene, press the spacebar a third time while in the air and hold to glide ( after releasing you can hold again to resume gliding if in the air )

shift - for sprinting on ground and if the character is in the air he will perform a quick dash

c - crouching, the character's collision box gets smaller by half its size ( the mesh doesn't change )

scroll wheel - for zooming in with the camera

mouse - for moving the camera

### Basic gameplay
sound bar - how loud the player is, gets higher when dropping objects

enemy - has a radius and moves towards the player, no collision effects implemented yet
