We'd like to receive the review on teams.
### Descriere Joc
The game has 3 scenes, the relevant one with all the information is Level 3, where we also have the lasers added. If the player touches the lasers, then a message in the console will appear.
### Mechanics
w,a,s,d - moving

spacebar - jumping ( can double jump )
         - for the first jump, upon holding the jump button longer, the character jumps higher

shift - for sprinting on ground and if the character is in the air he will perform a quick dash

c - crouching, the character's collision box gets smaller by half its size ( the mesh doesn't change )

### Basic gameplay
sound bar - how loud the player is, gets higher when dropping objects

enemy - has a radius and moves towards the player, no collision effects implemented yet
